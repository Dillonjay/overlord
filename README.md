### Using Overlord As A Project Manager
 * Log in with your GitHub account from the landing page.  This will direct you to your personal manager-dashboard page where your projects will be displayed on a timeline according to project start and due-dates.  
 * From your manager-dashboard page you have the ability to create a new project, create a new resource, assign a resource to a specific project by dragging and dropping, or destroy a resource by dragging it into the fire.  Currently assigned reources are also displayed by percentage and pie-chart in the resources per project box.  
 * Clicking a specific project's name in the project box takes you to the view for that project.  In the  project-view resources assigned to that project are displayed as well as project specific user-stories with description and completion status.  User-stories are also displayed in an Agile burndown-chart format.  A project's completion status is represented by a dragon-with-health-bar in keeping with the NES RPG spirit of Overlord.  User stories can be created, marked as completed, and deleted from the project-view.  A specific project can also be deleted from the project-view.
